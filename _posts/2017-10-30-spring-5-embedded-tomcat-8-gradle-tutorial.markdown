**TL;DR:** In this article, we are going to learn how to use Gradle to structure a Spring 5 project with Tomcat 8 embedded. We will start from an empty directory and will analyze each step needed to create an application that is distributed as an Ã¼ber/fat jar. [This GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/embedded-spring-5) is what we will get after following the steps describe here.

## Why Spring 5

[Spring](https://spring.io/) is [the most popular framework available for the Java platform](https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-web-frameworks-index-by-rebellabs/). As such, developers using Spring can count on a huge, thriving community. [The framework contains more than 11k forks on GitHub](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) and [more than 120k question asked on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring) are related to it.

This framework enables developers to easily create robust Java enterprise applications.
