**TL;DR:** In October, 2017, the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) released the Best Current Practices (BCP) when using OAuth 2.0 with native mobile applications. This BCP states that OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from native apps should _only_ be made through external user-agents, primarily the user's browser.
