## What are Innovation Labs?

**Innovation labs** are initiatives designed to promote and grow innovative thinking, services, and products. There are many ways that businesses approach the promotion of innovation, including forming strategic units or simply providing avenues for workers to network and collaborate. Some examples of corporate innovation labs include [Research at Google](https://research.google.com/), [Microsoft Research Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:15:0), [and more](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/corporate-innovation-labs/).

Innovation labs may have several aims, including but not limited to:

* **Ideation**: cultivating ideas and collaboration through hackathons, internal proposals, demos, and more.
* **Attracting talent**: companies that stay on the cusp of cutting-edge technology and foster a culture of innovation are more attractive to prospective employees.
* **Long-term revenue**: new products, services, and other offerings can have substantial long-term returns. In addition, bringing more ideation and production in-house reduces long-term costs.

## Identity Innovation

Innovations in identity technology have led us to more secure and more dynamic tools and practices.

### Frictionless Authentication with Passwordless

The evolution of [Passwordless authentication](https://auth0.com/passwordless) has allowed users to leave memorizing complicated passwords behind while enjoying improved security. Companies like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com) utilize Passwordless authentication to [increase engagement and enhance security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/increase-engagement-and-enhance-security-with-passwordless-authentication/). [Fingerprint Authentication](https://auth0.com/learn/fingerprint-authentication/) in mobile apps is also a form of Passwordless login that greatly improves the user experience. 

In fact, Passwordless biometric security is steadily gaining traction with identity innovations such as the [Biometric Wallet from Hammacher Schlemmer](http://www.hammacher.com/Product/81863) and [biometric credit card technology](http://www.sdcexec.com/news/12214482/new-biometric-credit-card-technology-is-an-important-advance-in-fraud-prevention).
