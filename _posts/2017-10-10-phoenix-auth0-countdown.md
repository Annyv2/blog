## Introduction to Elixir and Phoenix
- Elixir (based on Erlang, power of VM and threaded processes, fault tolerance etc...)
- Phoenix - not just a framework, but a stack Cowboy, Plug, and Ecto

## My first Phoenix app
- Step by step to get hello world running

## The countdown (and why?)
- Modify landing page for countdown
- Create models etc
- CRUD page for editing countdown

## Login with Auth0
- Setup hosted login page
- Setup auth on edit page
