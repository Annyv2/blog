**TL;DR:** In this series, you will learn how to create modern web applications with Python, Flask, and Angular. You will use this stack to build a SPA and a backend API to expose exams and questions so users can test their knowledge regarding different technologies. [In this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/online-exam/), you can find the final code created throughout the first part of the series.

## What You Will Build

In this series, you will use Python, Flask, and Angular to build a web application based on a modern architecture. With Angular, you will build a SPA (Single Page App) that allows users to browse through exams and questions. These users, when authenticated, will be able to test their knowledge regarding a specific topic by choosing one of the multiple choices that a question exposes. Then, when your users submit their answers, your backend will check if they are right or wrong, record the result, and send back this result to users.

In this part of the series, you will start by configuring Auth0 as the identity management system of your app. You will configure an Auth0 API to represent and secure your Flask application and you will configure an Auth0 Client to represent and secure your Angular SPA. After securing your app with Auth0, you are going to enhance the application to allow users to test their knowledge.
