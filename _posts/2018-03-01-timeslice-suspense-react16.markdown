**TL;DR:** ReactJS is a UI library that's a very powerful tool amongst frontend developers in building JavaScript applications. In this article, I'll introduce you to a few features coming to React.

---

ReactJS is a JavaScript library, built and maintained by Facebook. As of today, it powers so many popular web and mobile platforms such as Twitter, Airbnb, Lyft, Dropbox, Pinterest, Whatsapp and Instagram. The latest release of ReactJS which is _React 16_ ships with a lot of features such as `Error Boundaries`, `Custom DOM Attributes definition`, `Fragements as return types`, `Portals` and so many others.

A total rewrite of React which runs on a new engine, _React Fiber_ is React 16. However, the ReactJS team is not slacking. They are hard at work looking for new ways to make React a highly performant library in UI component development. A sneak peek into new features coming to React was demo'd by the _creator of Redux_ and _React core team member_, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) at JSConf Iceland, 2018.
