## Overview

Throughout this article, we're going to see how a huge graphics cards manufacturer took advantage of Auth0 to consolidate user identities from multiple applications. Before relying on Auth0, each application hosted by the manufacturer had its own identity management. That is, if John Doe had access to more than one app, he would have to manage (and remember) two or more credentials. Of course, he could have the same combination of email and password for all applications. But if, for whatever reason, he had to change the password for one of them, his other accounts wouldn't be affected. Not to say that its personal data, like address, would have to be manually updated on each application.

This kind of scenario, although common, is not good for the end user nor to the apps' owner. From the manufacturer point of view, if they wanted to implement a new security feature, they would have to refactor multiple applications. Even more, if they wanted to communicate with their users, they wouldn't have a single source of truth showing how many distinct users they had or the its personal details (as it could be out of date on one app, and up to date on another).

Gladly for the manufacturer, and for companies with similar scenarios, Auth0 facilitates the consolidation of identities on situations like that.

## Simulating Multiple Apps

To simulate the manufacturer's scenario, we will use two Node.js applications that are dependent on different databases. There are some users with the same credentials (email and password) on each application and some users that exist only on one application or another. When a user exists on both applications, some details of its personal data will differ on one account and the other. These differences were created to show how merging profiles from different applications is easy with Auth0.

To follow along this article and see the profile consolidation in practice, we will just need to [sign up for a free Auth0 account](javascript:signup\(\)) and configure a few settings on it. This Auth0 account will then communicate with both apps, hosted [here](http://node-app-1.tk/) and [here](http://node-app-2.tk/), to perform the following steps:

- Check, during sign in, if a credential is valid or not.
- Check, during a password retrieval or a sign up, if an email address exists on one of the applications.

The credential verification and the email verification processes occur through requests made by Auth0 to both applications. These requests are issued by two [Auth0 rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current) that we will configure in our account. On both cases, if the user does exist and it contains profiles on both application, these profiles are merged and saved on Auth0. If the user exists on only one of the applications, this single profile is used.

## Security Notes

As both applications have to expose endpoints that Auth0 will consume, we needed to secure these endpoints to avoid attacks from unknown sources. At Auth0 we favor standards, therefore we are going to secure our apps with the OAuth 2.0 grant, called [Client Credentials](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/client-credentials), that machine-to-machine interfaces utilize to communicate.

With Client Credentials Grant (defined in [RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) a Non Interactive Client (a CLI, a daemon, or a Service running on your backend), can directly ask Auth0 for an `access_token`, by using its Client Credentials (Client Id and Client Secret) to authenticate. In this case the token represents the Non Interactive Client itself, instead of an end user.

![Client Credentials Grant Flow](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/media/articles/api-auth/client-credentials-grant.png)

In our scenario, the Auth0 rules that we are going to create will retrieve an `access_token` from Auth0, and then use this token to identify itself on both applications. These applications were previously [secured with a Express middleware that validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://github.com/auth0-blog/graphic-cards-case-study/blob/master/index.js) generated by Auth0 with the following characteristics:

- audience: 'http://sample-app/'
- issuer: 'https://bkrebs.auth0.com/'
- algorithms: ['RS256']

Since the applications are expecting JWTs with the `https://bkrebs.auth0.com/` issuer, we will use in our exercise a `client_id` and a `client_secret` previously configured on my own Auth0 account (`bkrebs`). For the sake of completeness, we will recreate these properties to understand the process, but we won't use them.

## Consolidating Identities with Auth0



### Creating an Auth0 API

- Sample App
- http://sample-app/
- RS256

### Creating an Auth0 Client

- Non Interactive Clients
- Consolidating Identity

### Creating a Database Connection

- use my own database (custom database)
- Import Users to Auth0 (settings)
