## SAP to Acquire Gigya 

[On September 24, 2017 Gigya announced that they will be acquired by SAP](http://www.gigya.com/gigya-the-market-leader-in-customer-identity-and-access-management-to-be-acquired-by-sap/). [Gigya](http://gigya.com) offers a Customer Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform. [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html) is buying Gigya to enhance its [Hybris Profile service](https://www.yaas.io/products/saphybrisprofile.html). Gigya currently manages 1.3 billion customer identities.

With this news, Gigya customers should be very interested in learning more about SAP's plans for an integration strategy. The acquisition announcement stated the following:

> "Gigya’s consent-based identity data platform and SAP Hybris® Profile data matching and enrichment capabilities to be integrated" —[Gigya Press Release](http://www.gigya.com/gigya-the-market-leader-in-customer-identity-and-access-management-to-be-acquired-by-sap/)

SAP has announced that the acquisition will allow them to offer a cloud-based data platform for user data collection and that Gigya's 300+ employees will become part of the SAP Hybris business unit.

## What Does This Mean for Gigya Customers?

It is currently unclear whether Gigya's services and APIs will remain intact after the business transaction with SAP is completed.

When [Microsoft acquired LinkedIn](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/microsoft-officially-closes-its-26-2b-acquisition-of-linkedin/), the professional social networking community was integrated more directly with Microsoft properties such as Office and Active Directory, but LinkedIn itself remained its own entity, promoting continued innovation and self-sufficiency. LinkedIn users saw very little change in how they interacted with the platform. On the other hand, [Okta's acquisition of Stormpath resulted in the complete shutdown of Stormpath's service and APIs](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3177227/security/okta-acquires-stormpath-to-boost-its-identity-services-for-developers.html). At the time of writing, SAP has not announced its integration strategy for Gigya. This creates uncertainty for customers.

## Conclusion

SAP and Gigya have an acquisition agreement in place. At the time of the announcement, there is no established integration strategy for Gigya customers to review and consider. Hopefully additional clarity around the future of Gigya's product and customers is coming in the near future. It may be prudent to consider all possibilities, including potential opportunities with other IAM offerings. Auth0's platform for identity and access management is powerful and straightforward to use for admins, developers, and end users.

Auth0 provides simple, easy-to-use [user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities](https://auth0.com/user-management), including password resets, provisioning, blocking, and deleting users. Migration of users to and from Auth0 is easy, as is social and enterprise identity provider implementation.
