## SAP to Acquire Gigya 

[On September 24, 2017 Gigya announced that they will be acquired by SAP](http://www.gigya.com/gigya-the-market-leader-in-customer-identity-and-access-management-to-be-acquired-by-sap/). [Gigya](http://gigya.com) offers a Customer Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform. [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html) is buying Gigya to enhance its [Hybris Profile service](https://www.yaas.io/products/saphybrisprofile.html). Gigya currently manages 1.3 billion customer identities.

With this news, Gigya customers should be very interested in learning more about SAP's plans for an integration strategy. The acquisition announcement stated the following:

> "Gigya’s consent-based identity data platform and SAP Hybris® Profile data matching and enrichment capabilities to be integrated" —[Gigya Press Release](http://www.gigya.com/gigya-the-market-leader-in-customer-identity-and-access-management-to-be-acquired-by-sap/)

SAP has announced that the acquisition will allow them to offer a cloud-based data platform for user data collection and that Gigya's 300+ employees will become part of the SAP Hybris business unit.

## Assessing an IAM Platform

It is currently unclear whether Gigya's services and APIs will remain functionally equivalent after the business transaction with SAP is completed. At the time of writing, SAP has not announced its _integration strategy_ for Gigya. This creates uncertainty for customers.

There are several features and key interests to look for when assessing a new IAM platform, or _re-assessing_ your existing platform when it is acquired by a different company. Let's explore them now:

### Customer and Platform Support

Excellent **customer support** is a key feature of any product, and especially so with products offered as-a-service. Make sure  the platform has a robust and responsive support system with a dedicated and knowledgeable team of experts who can assist with both administrator and developer needs.

Continued **platform support and development** is vital as well. A product should be actively supported and improved. Potential customers should look for continued innovation, features, and added support for new security regulations, technologies, and applications.

### Core Competency of the Company

When assessing the future of a platform that has been bought by a different company, it's especially important to assess the core competency of the acquiring company. **Core competency** refers to the main strengths and technical capacity of the company in the marketplace.

For example, if you are responsible for a healthcare institution and you have an IAM solution already, you likely chose that solution with certain things in mind, such as HIPAA compliance, enterprise federation, and auditing and monitoring capabilities. However, if your current platform is then acquired by a company whose core competency is limited to retail and e-commerce, your platform's support for the features you need may decrease significantly or even be discontinued altogether.

### Flexibility to Manage Multiple Business Use Cases on a Single Platform

A platform's **ability to fully support multiple business use cases** is a key feature to look for. Regardless of your _current_ primary use case, you should assess the product's capability to use a single platform for [B2B](https://auth0.com/b2b-enterprise-identity-management), [B2C](https://auth0.com/b2c-customer-identity-management), [B2E](https://auth0.com/b2e-identity-management-for-employees), [IoT](https://auth0.com/docs/tutorials/authenticating-devices-using-mqtt), [Cloud IAM](https://auth0.com/learn/cloud-identity-access-management/), and more. This flexibility means that as your business grows and expands its needs, your IAM platform will enable and support that growth with ease.

### Security and Compliance

## Conclusion

SAP and Gigya have an acquisition agreement in place. At the time of the announcement, there is no established integration strategy for Gigya customers to review and consider. Hopefully additional clarity around the future of Gigya's product and customers is coming in the near future. It may be prudent to consider all possibilities, including potential opportunities with other IAM offerings. Auth0's platform for identity and access management is powerful and straightforward to use for admins, developers, and end users.

Auth0 provides simple, easy-to-use [user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities](https://auth0.com/user-management), including password resets, provisioning, blocking, and deleting users. Migration of users to and from Auth0 is easy, as is social and enterprise identity provider implementation.
