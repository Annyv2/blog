How do you stay safe while shopping online? I'll expatiate on six tips that can help you shop safely online on **Cyber Monday**

1. **Ensure the Site is Secure by looking out for https URL**

Once you visit a website, ensure that the site has Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption installed. The website will start with *https://* and a locked padlock will also present in the address bar, mostly next to the URL. Don't atttempt to buy anything with your credit/debit card on a website that has no SSL installed.

2. **Avoid using weak passwords**

Hackers maintain a list of commonly used passwords that are deployed via bots to try on various websites at a time. Using a weak password increases the risk of having your credentials in those lists. If you currently have a weak password on the sites you shop with regularly, it's time to change it to a very [strong](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/password-strength) password. Here are some tips to help you create a secure password:

* Use a long password, at least 10 characters with a combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Avoid using common information such as your name, social security number, nickname and so on.

3. **Look out for Fake and Forged Sites**

During this shopping period, cyber criminals go lengths to replicate popular websites. Users get tricked into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, social security numbers and credit card details on fake versions of popular sites, thinking that they are logged onto the real site.

Here are some tips to ensure you don't log into a forged site:

* Look out for the encryption symbol, *padlock*, on the URL. Verify that the site is secure by ensuring the URL starts with **https://** instead of **http**
* Look out for typos on the site name and URL.
* Look out for fake ads and emails.
* Get an anti-phishing software. Popular examples are **Kapersky**, **Avast**

These brands have experienced **cyber monday** events various times and have improved their **tech**, to provide very robust security measures to handle the numerous online shoppers that will log onto their platform.

Furthermore, a developer has the option to define the complexity of passwords that users enter during signups as provided in the [password policies](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/password-strength).

## Conclusion
